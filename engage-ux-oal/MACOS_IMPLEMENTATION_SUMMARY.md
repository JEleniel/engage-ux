# macOS Backend Implementation Summary

## Status: ✅ Complete

The macOS backend for Engage UX has been successfully implemented using safe, cross-platform libraries that provide native-like behavior while maintaining 100% safe Rust code.

## Implementation Overview

### Architecture Decision

Rather than using direct Objective-C/Swift bindings (which would require unsafe code), the implementation leverages:

-	**winit 0.30**: Provides safe Rust abstractions over Cocoa/AppKit's NSWindow
-	**softbuffer 0.4**: Provides safe software rendering compatible with Core Graphics

This approach satisfies all project requirements:

-	✅ **100% Safe Rust**: No unsafe code (enforced by `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`)
-	✅ **Native Integration**: winit uses NSWindow internally, providing true native behavior
-	✅ **Core Graphics Compatible**: softbuffer's rendering maps cleanly to Core Graphics operations
-	✅ **Accessibility Ready**: Window properties expose NSAccessibility attributes
-	✅ **Platform Conventions**: Follows macOS window management patterns

### Components Implemented

#### 1. MacOSBackendFactory

**Location**: `engage-ux-oal/src/backends/mod.rs`

Factory implementation that creates platform-specific backends:

```rust
#[cfg(target_os = "macos")]
impl BackendFactory for MacOSBackendFactory {
    fn create_renderer(&self) -> Box<dyn RenderBackend>;
    fn create_window_backend(&self) -> Box<dyn WindowBackend>;
}
```

#### 2. WinitWindowBackend

**Location**: `engage-ux-oal/src/backends/winit_window.rs`

Window management through winit's NSWindow wrapper:

-	Window creation, destruction, and lifecycle
-	Title bar management (NSWindow.title)
-	Visibility control (orderFront:/orderOut:)
-	State management (normal, minimized, maximized, fullscreen)
-	Position and size control (setFrame:display:)
-	Focus management (makeKeyAndOrderFront:)
-	Event handling (NSWindowDelegate equivalent)
-	DPI scaling for Retina displays (backingScaleFactor)

#### 3. SoftbufferRenderer

**Location**: `engage-ux-oal/src/backends/softbuffer_renderer.rs`

Software rendering compatible with Core Graphics:

-	Clear operations (CGContextClearRect)
-	Rectangle filling (CGContextFillRect)
-	Rectangle stroking (CGContextStrokeRect)
-	Circle/ellipse drawing (CGContextFillEllipseInRect)
-	Line drawing (CGContextStrokePath)
-	Clipping regions (CGContextClip)
-	RGBA color space support

## Testing

-	Backend factory creation
-	Renderer operations
-	Window backend operations

### Running Tests

On macOS:

```bash
# All tests
cargo test --all

# macOS-specific tests only
cargo test --test test_macos_backend

# Platform backend tests
cargo test --test test_platform_backends
```

On other platforms:

-	macOS-specific tests are skipped (gated with `#[cfg(target_os = "macos")]`)
-	Cross-platform tests run using the appropriate platform backend
