# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

Common questions about Engage UX.

## General Questions

### What is Engage UX?

Engage UX is a fully cross-platform Rust UI toolkit that provides a themable component library without depending on a browser engine. It's designed to create native-feeling applications that work consistently across Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS.

### Why "Engage"?

Named after Captain Jean-Luc Picard's famous "Engage!" command from Star Trek, reflecting the toolkit's flagship LCARS-inspired theme and its mission to empower developers to confidently build cross-platform UIs.

### Is Engage UX production-ready?

Engage UX is currently in Phase 2 (v0.2.0) with all core components and systems implemented. Platform-specific rendering backends are planned for Phase 3. It's suitable for development and prototyping, with production readiness targeting v1.0.0 in Q3 2025.

### What makes Engage UX different?

- **No browser engine**: Unlike Electron or Tauri, doesn't bundle Chromium
- **True cross-platform**: Single codebase for desktop and mobile
- **100% Rust**: Type-safe, memory-safe, no `unsafe` code
- **Fully themable**: JSON-based themes with complete customization
- **Async-first**: Built on Tokio for responsive UIs
- **Accessibility-ready**: WCAG AAA infrastructure built-in

## Installation and Setup

## Troubleshooting

### Build errors with linker

**Solution**: Ensure platform-specific build tools are installed:

**Windows**: Visual Studio Build Tools
**macOS**: Xcode Command Line Tools
**Linux**: GCC/Clang and X11 development headers

### Components not rendering

**Explanation**: Phase 2 implements component logic and architecture. Full rendering requires platform-specific backends (Phase 3).

### Theme fails to load

**Solution**: Validate JSON against the [theme schema](../schemas/theme.schema.json).

### Tests failing

**Solution**:
1. Update Rust: `rustup update`
2. Clean build: `cargo clean && cargo build`
3. Run specific test: `cargo test <test_name>`

### Import errors

**Solution**: Ensure all crates are included in `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
engage-ux-core = { git = "..." }
engage-ux-components = { git = "..." }
engage-ux-themes = { git = "..." }
engage-ux-oal = { git = "..." }
```

## Future Plans

### When will v1.0.0 be released?

Target: Q3 2025 (see [Roadmap](roadmap.md))

### What's next after Phase 2?

Phase 3 focuses on platform-specific backends:
- Windows, macOS, Linux rendering
- Native window management
- Mobile platform support

### Will there be a GUI designer?

Visual component editor is planned for Phase 4.

### Can I sponsor development?

Sponsorship options coming soon. Follow the project for updates.
