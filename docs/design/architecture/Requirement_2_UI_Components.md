# Requirements: UI Components Library

## Overview

The UI Components Library provides a complete set of 50 components covering informational, interactive, graphic, notification, menu, dialog, and layout needs. All components are themable, accessible, and work consistently across all supported platforms.

## User Story

As an application developer, I need a comprehensive library of UI components (buttons, inputs, dialogs, menus, etc.) that work consistently across Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS, so that I can build rich user interfaces without having to implement platform-specific code or worry about accessibility and theming.

3. Graphic and Display Components (2 components)
4. Notification Components (3 components)
5. Menu Components (4 components)
6. Window Control Components (3 components)
7. Pane Group Components (2 components)
8. Dialog Components (5 components)
9. Layout/Grouping Components (4 components)
