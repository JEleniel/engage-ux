# Requirements: Core System

## Overview

The Core System provides the foundation layer for Engage UX, including color management, component infrastructure, event handling, and thread-safe primitives. This forms the base upon which all other components and systems are built.

## User Story

As a UI toolkit developer, I need a robust foundation layer that provides essential functionality like color management, component traits, event handling, and thread-safe operations, so that I can build a complete set of UI components that work consistently across all supported platforms without worrying about low-level implementation details.

## Features

1. Color System with RGB/HSL support
2. Component Trait and Base Structures
3. Event System with async support
4. Thread-Safe Component References
5. Input System (Keyboard, Mouse, Touch)
6. Accessibility Infrastructure
7. Media Support (Fonts, Images, SVG)
8. Rendering Abstractions

**Mouse**:
- Support mouse buttons (Left, Right, Middle, Extra buttons)
- Track mouse position
- Support mouse events (ButtonDown, ButtonUp, Move, Wheel, Enter, Leave)
- Track button state
- Support wheel scrolling (horizontal and vertical)

**Touch**:
- Support multi-touch with touch point tracking
- Support touch phases (Began, Moved, Ended, Cancelled)
- Support gesture recognition (pinch, pan)
- Track touch state with multiple touch points
- Calculate gesture deltas and scales

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- All keyboard keys have defined key codes
- Key modifiers can be combined using bitwise operations
- Mouse position is tracked accurately
- Mouse buttons are tracked separately
- Touch points are identified uniquely
- Gestures are recognized from touch sequences
- Input state is thread-safe
- Components can implement InputHandler trait

### Feature Detail: Accessibility Infrastructure
