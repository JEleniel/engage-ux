# Requirements: OS Abstraction Layer (OAL)

## Overview

The OS Abstraction Layer (OAL) provides platform-independent interfaces for window management, graphics rendering, and platform-specific functionality. This allows the same UI components to work across Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS without modification.

## User Story

As a cross-platform application developer, I need an abstraction layer that handles platform-specific differences for window management, graphics rendering, and OS integration, so that I can write my application code once and have it work identically on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS.

## Features

1. Platform Detection and Initialization
2. Window Management Abstraction
3. Graphics Rendering Backend Abstraction
4. Platform Factory Pattern
5. Native Platform Implementations
6. Stub/Mock Implementations for Testing

### Feature Detail: Platform Detection and Initialization

**Description**: Automatic detection of the current platform and initialization of platform-specific backends.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Platform is detected correctly on all supported OS
- Platform detection works at compile time where possible
- Platform name is accessible programmatically
- Initialization selects correct backend

- Support borderless windows
- Support window opacity/transparency
- Support always-on-top windows
- Support window z-order

### Feature Detail: Graphics Rendering Backend Abstraction

**Description**: Platform-independent graphics rendering API.

**Requirements**:

- Support blend modes
- Support opacity
- Clear render target
- Present/swap buffers
- Support different render targets (window, offscreen buffer)

**Platform-Specific Backends**:
- **Windows**: Direct2D/Direct3D or Skia
- **macOS**: Core Graphics or Skia
- **Linux**: Cairo or Skia
- **Android**: Canvas API or Skia
- **iOS**: Core Graphics or Skia

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Render backend API is platform-independent
- All backends implement same interface
- Rendering produces consistent visual results across platforms
- Performance is acceptable on all platforms
- Render commands are efficient
- Clipping works correctly
- Transformations are accurate
- Text rendering is high-quality
- Images are rendered without artifacts

### Feature Detail: Platform Factory Pattern

**Description**: Factory pattern for creating platform-specific implementations.

**Requirements**:
- Factory creates platform-specific window backend
- Factory creates platform-specific render backend
- Factory selection based on platform detection
- Support dependency injection for testing
- Allow custom backend registration
- Provide stub implementations for testing
- Support backend capability queries

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Factory creates correct backend for each platform
- Stub backends are used when native unavailable
- Custom backends can be registered
- Factory is thread-safe
- Backend creation is lazy (on-demand)
- Backend errors are handled gracefully

### Feature Detail: Native Platform Implementations

**Description**: Platform-specific implementations of OAL interfaces.

**Requirements**:

**Windows Implementation**:
- Use Win32 APIs for window management
- Use Direct2D/Direct3D or Skia for rendering

- Handle Windows-specific events
- Support Windows accessibility APIs

**macOS Implementation**:
- Use Cocoa/AppKit for window management
- Use Core Graphics or Skia for rendering
- Support macOS-specific features (menu bar, dock)
- Handle macOS-specific events
- Support macOS accessibility APIs

**Linux Implementation**:
- Support both X11 and Wayland
- Use GTK+ or Qt for window management
- Use Cairo or Skia for rendering
- Support Linux-specific features
- Handle both X11 and Wayland events
- Support Linux accessibility APIs (AT-SPI)

**Android Implementation**:
- Use Android Activity for window management
- Use Canvas API or Skia for rendering
- Support Android lifecycle
- Handle Android touch events
- Support Android accessibility (TalkBack)

**iOS Implementation**:
- Use UIKit for window management
- Use Core Graphics or Skia for rendering
- Support iOS lifecycle
- Handle iOS touch events

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Each platform implementation works natively
- Platform-specific features are accessible
- Implementations follow platform conventions
- Performance is optimized for each platform
- Platform-specific APIs are used correctly
- Memory management follows platform guidelines
- Thread-safety follows platform requirements

### Feature Detail: Stub/Mock Implementations for Testing

**Description**: Test implementations that allow development and testing without native platform backends.

**Requirements**:
- Stub window backend that tracks window state
