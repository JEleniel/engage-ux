## How to Use This Documentation

### 1. Getting Started
Start with the [Quick Reference](Quick_Reference.md) for an overview and common patterns.

### 2. Understanding the System
Read the [System Architecture](System_Architecture.md) to understand the overall design.

### 3. Implementing Features
- Review the relevant requirement document
- Study the architecture diagrams
- Check the NFRs for quality requirements
- Follow the implementation guidelines in the agent documentation

### 4. Understanding Data Flow
Refer to [Data Flow](Data_Flow.md) to understand how data moves through the system.

### 5. Working with Components
See [Component Architecture](Component_Architecture.md) for component patterns and lifecycle.

## Related Documentation

### Agent Documentation
Located in `docs/design/agents/`:
- **IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md** - Current implementation status
- **TODO.md** - Implementation roadmap with detailed guidelines

## Design Principles

### 1. Cross-Platform First
All designs support Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS with feature parity.

### 2. Safety First
All code must be memory-safe (`#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`).

### 3. Accessibility First
WCAG AAA compliance is required, not optional.

### 4. Performance Matters
Target 60 FPS for smooth user experience.

### 5. Async by Default
Use Tokio async runtime for non-blocking operations.

### 6. Thread-Safe
All shared state must be thread-safe.

### 7. Test Everything
Aim for 90% test coverage with comprehensive tests.

### 8. Document Well
All public APIs must have documentation comments.

### 9. Fail Gracefully
Handle errors properly, never panic in production.

### 10. Follow Standards
Comply with WCAG AAA, Rust API guidelines, and industry standards.

## Architecture Patterns

### Trait-Based Architecture
- `Component` trait for all UI elements
- `RenderBackend` trait for platform-specific rendering
- `WindowBackend` trait for platform-specific windows
- `InputHandler` trait for input processing

### Factory Pattern
- Platform-specific backend creation
- Component creation with builders

### Observer Pattern
- Event system with broadcast channels
- Component callbacks for state changes

### Strategy Pattern
- Different rendering strategies per platform
- Different window management strategies per platform

### Adapter Pattern
- OS APIs adapted to unified interface
- Color format conversions

### Command Pattern
- Render commands for graphics operations
- Event commands for user interactions

## Version History
