# Agent Project Plan

This file is intended for machine agents and maintainers to coordinate automated work on the Engage UX repository.

Last updated: 2025-10-27

## Purpose

Provide a concise project plan for agent-driven tasks: feature implementation, tests, documentation updates, and release preparation.

## High-level milestones

- Phase A: Close remaining integration and visual tests (target: 40 tests)
- Phase B: Visual regression baseline capture (20 tests)
- Phase C: Performance benchmarks and profiling (10 tests)
- Phase D: Documentation completion and examples
- Phase E: Release preparation and tagging

## How agents should operate

- Always consult `docs/design/agents/TODO.md` and `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` before making changes.
- Create small, focused branches for each task (feature/bugfix/docs).
- Open a PR with a clear description, changelog entry, and tests where applicable.
- Update `docs/design/agents/TODO.md` on task completion.

## Contact and escalation

If an agent encounters non-deterministic failures or CI issues, escalate to repository maintainers listed in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
