# Implementation Roadmap

## Architecture Reference

Before implementing any features, review the architecture documentation in `docs/design/architecture/`:

- **[System Architecture](../architecture/System_Architecture.md)** - Understand the layered architecture and crate organization
- **[Component Architecture](../architecture/Component_Architecture.md)** - Learn component patterns and rendering pipeline
- **[Data Flow](../architecture/Data_Flow.md)** - Understand how data flows through the system
- **[NFRs](../architecture/NFRs.md)** - Ensure all implementations meet non-functional requirements (security, accessibility, performance)

Each requirement document includes detailed specifications and acceptance criteria for implementation.

## Phase 7 (Future)

Future work for client/server rendering:

- Support for client/server rendering.
    - Mode 1 (default): The server renders the image, using the monitor layout of the client, and sends the compressed, rendered view to the client. The client then displays the view, and returns any input to the server. This is meant for use cases where the server has the rendering horsepower.
    - Mode 2: The server sends all information required to render the UX to the client who then renders the view. The client sends any input events to the server. This is meant for the use case where the client has rendering horsepower.
    - The entire connection must be encrypted with a minimum equivalent to TLS 1.3 (you may use HTTPS and TLS 1.3 if it will be performant enough). Both client and server must support using the OS Certificate Authorities as well as configurable additional CAs. The server must support both encrypted and unencrypted key files.
    - All connections must be fully authenticated. Support for built in Windows authentication (including Active Directory), Linux PAM, LDAP, and OAuth are required. Support for basic user/password authentication will not be supported.
    - Minimally, the system must be able to render, send, and display 24fps video without noticable stuttering or any degradation. Ideally, it should be able to support 4k 120fps, given sufficient bandwidth.

## Implementation Guidelines For Machine Agents

When implementing features, follow these guidelines:

### Review Architecture First
- Read the relevant architecture documents before coding
- Understand the requirements and acceptance criteria
- Review the NFRs to ensure compliance
- Study the diagrams to understand system interactions

### Follow Design Patterns

### Backend Implementation Checklist

When implementing a platform backend:

- [ ] Implement platform-specific trait (WindowBackend or RenderBackend)
- [ ] Handle all required operations
- [ ] Convert between Engage types and platform types
- [ ] Handle platform-specific events
- [ ] Ensure thread safety
- [ ] Handle errors gracefully
