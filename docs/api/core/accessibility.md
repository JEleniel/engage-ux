# Accessibility

Accessibility support in `engage-ux-core` exposes types and helpers to build WCAG-compliant components.

Key items:

- `AccessibilityProps` — props for ARIA roles, labels, and accessibility attributes.
- `FocusManager` — keyboard focus orchestration helper.
- `ScreenReader` — utilities for announcements and integration with platform screen readers.
